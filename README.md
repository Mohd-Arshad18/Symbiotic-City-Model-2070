🌆 Symbi-City: The Futuristic Smart City

🔎 Overview

Symbi-City is a futuristic 3D interactive smart city designed to showcase how people can experience healthcare, education, transport, work, and social life through their digital twin (avatar). It provides an immersive experience where users interact with different hubs (Clinic, School, Social Hub, Office, etc.), book futuristic pods for transport, and even teleport globally — all within a virtual city.

🎯 Problem We Solve

In today’s world, people often face challenges like:
	•	Accessibility → Reaching clinics, schools, or offices in time.
	•	Overcrowding → Wasting time in queues for doctors, bookings, or travel.
	•	Lack of integration → Different services exist separately and don’t connect into one ecosystem.

Symbi-City solves these by creating a connected digital ecosystem where your avatar represents you and helps manage your daily activities in one place.
