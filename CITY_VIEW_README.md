## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` - Useful helpers and components
- `three` - 3D graphics library
- `framer-motion` - Animation library

### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FuturisticCity.tsx      # Main 3D city component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CityView.tsx            # City view page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx                     # Updated with /city route
```

### Key Components
- `FuturisticCity` - Main container with 3D canvas
- `CityScene` - 3D scene with buildings and effects
- `Building` - Individual building with interactions
- `InfoPanel` - Floating information display
- `MiniMap` - HUD showing city overview
- `FloatingVehicles` - Animated city traffic

## Performance Optimizations

### Rendering
- Lightweight geometries (basic shapes)
- Efficient material usage
- Optimized lighting setup
- Smooth animations with requestAnimationFrame

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of Three.js resources
- Efficient state management
- Minimal re-renders

## Customization

### Adding New Buildings
1. Add building data to `BUILDINGS` array in `FuturisticCity.tsx`
2. Include: id, name, position, description, color, size
3. Buildings automatically get interactivity and info panels

### Modifying Visual Style
- Update colors in `BUILDINGS` array
- Modify materials in `Building` component
- Adjust lighting in `Lighting` component
- Change ground and road appearances

### Adding New Features
- Extend `CityScene` component
- Add new 3D objects and effects
- Implement additional UI components
- Enhance camera controls

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

### Requirements
- WebGL support
- Modern JavaScript features
- Sufficient GPU memory for 3D rendering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Black Screen**: Check WebGL support
2. **Performance Issues**: Reduce building count or effects
3. **Camera Issues**: Reset camera position or controls
4. **Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Performance Tips
- Use lower quality on mobile devices
- Reduce lighting complexity if needed
- Limit simultaneous animations
- Monitor frame rate in browser dev tools

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Building interiors and detailed views
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Weather effects and atmospheric conditions
- Sound effects and ambient audio
- Multi-user interaction and avatars
- Integration with real-time city data

### Technical Improvements
- Level of detail (LOD) system
- Texture mapping and materials
- Particle effects and animations
- Advanced shader effects
- VR/AR compatibility
